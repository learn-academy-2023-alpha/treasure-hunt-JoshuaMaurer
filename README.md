# üí∞ React Treasure Hunt Game

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a treasure hunt game. The user will see a game board on the page and be able to select various squares on the board. Hidden behind one square is a treasure that will win the game and hidden behind another square is a bomb that will lose the game. All other squares will reveal a neutral image. The user will be given a particular number of clicks to find the treasure that will win the game.

### ü§î Remember

- Pseudocode!!
- Ask clarifying questions

### üìö User Stories
**Story 1**
// good dev workflow. EACH user stpry becomes it's own branch. is pushed seperately and it's own PR is created.
- As a user, I can see a page with a three by three grid board game with a question mark in each square.
//  branch: grid
// iterate on board state variable to display square component for each element.
// use styling to set up grid
// set up a <div> for all boxes to be able to use flexbox
// Passed the current value of the iterated board into Square props.
// Show props inside div in square and destructure
// Center and resize "?"

**Story 2**

//Branch: alert-index    
- As a user, when I click on one of the question marks an alert appears with the index position of that question mark in the array.
// Setup an onClick on the Square component: <div>
// The onClick will trigger a handle click function that will have an alert with the index of the square that is being clicked
// Will need to pass index as props to Square
// To gain access to the index being clicked, we need to pass index into a function an App.js from Square.

**Story 3**
- As a user, when I click on one of the question marks an alert appears with the index position of that question mark in the array.

**Story 4**
- As a user, when I click on one of the question marks instead of the alert the question mark turns into a tree emoji.
//Branch: tree-emoji
// Create a copy of our state array
// index allows us to use bracket notation to update the element that was clicked to a tree emoji
//Update state using setBoard method with the modified copied array.

**Story 5**
- As a user, if I select the winning square the question mark will become a treasure emoji and if I select the losing square the question mark will become a bomb emoji.
  // Branch: winner-loser
  // Randomize winning box index and store in a state variable  
  // Randomize losing box index and store in a state variable 
  // Create some conditional logic to check if selected box is the winning box or losing box when clicking on the box
  // 

**Story 6**  
- As a user, I can click on a ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù button that will restart the game.
- // Branch: restart
- // create function to reset to original state
- // Create a button using onClick that invokes this function
- // Get to work better that just having the static values in the reset array
- 
- As a user, I can see a counter that shows how many guesses I have left. The counter starts at five and decrements one every time I click on a square that is not the treasure nor the bomb.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I won the game if I select the square that contains the treasure.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I lost the game if I select the square that contains the bomb.
- As a user, I cannot continue to play the game after I win or lose.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I lost the game when I run out of turns (the counter reaches zero).

### üèî Stretch Goals

- Consider how to handle a situation where the bomb and the treasure are at the same index.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Stretch Goals

- As a developer, I have a well commented application.
- As a developer, I have well written README file with instructions on how to access my repository.
- As a developer, my variables are all named semantically.
- As a developer, I have refactored and efficient code.
- As a developer, I have my application [deployed as a live website](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app).
